# Other files generated by AndroidStudio
# I am ignoring these, even though it means your project won't build
# I found with moving android studio from one computer to another the
# project wouldn't build anyway.  There is probably a way to get this to 
# work, but I don't know what it is, so I'll just track my custom files
# for now.
