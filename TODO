TODO 

Bug 
 - max width not correct in info right col
 - Map Editor menu tiles stretched vertically
 - Show a toast when no human controllable teams (world exits)
 - Ensure visibilty for all squares 1 step away, even if in mountain/forest
 - Web effect not releasing or showing icon
 - Script end conditions
 - Trigger editor allow setting none

Refactor 
 - bgMap and unit should be a Map keyed on position, this would be much faster than iterating the list
   it would mean you can't have two units on the same position... I don't think you would ever need 
   two backgrounds on the same position though. 

Play 
 - Scrolling text area in info right col
 - Bounds checking on unit movement

Map Views(Both)
 - zooming out to max view causes warp...


Optional Features : 
 - Back story screen
 - More info (popup) on ability in info area
 - Animations for abilities? 
 - Sync: BG, Units, Abilities, Mods, Effects
 - UI view event log (maybe text input - talking)
 - Inventory / Equipping (maybe with level-up)
