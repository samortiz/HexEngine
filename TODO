TODO 

Edit  
 - Map Editor menu tiles stretched vertically
 - Trigger editor allow setting none

Play 
 - max width not correct in info right col
 - Scrolling text area in info right col, shorten info text
 - Bounds checking on unit movement
 - Show a toast when no human controllable teams (world exits)
 - add death check to getAllMyUnits, or AI may not get notified of the death of their units
 - bgMap and unit should be a Map keyed on position, this would be much faster than iterating the list
   it would mean you can't have two units on the same position... I don't think you would ever need 
   two backgrounds on the same position though. 
 - deselect dead units
 - Popup info for unit including ability and current effects info, shorten main info 
 - Move AI processing to a separte thread with a progress bar
 - Back story screen


Map Views(Both)
 - zooming out to max view causes warp...

Optional Features : 
 - Add more ability icons so there is some variety
 - Animations for abilities? 
 - File Sync: BG, Units, Abilities, Mods, Effects, AI, Triggers (Definitely Mods, AI, Triggers need a sync)
 - UI view event log (maybe text input - talking)
