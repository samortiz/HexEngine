Hex Board Game Engine

For creating hex-based board games

SETUP
 I removed all the AndroidStudio files from the repo. 
I found that moving my code from one computer to another with different installs of AndroidStudio caused
it to fail to open the project.  It was kind of annyoing, so I will just track the custom code and none 
of the generated files. That means in order to get this projec to work you need to do the following :

 - Install AndroidStudio
 - Create a new project called HexEngine
 - In your filesystem renamed the HexEngine to OrigHexEngine
 - clone the git repo into a new folder named HexEngine
   mkdir HexEngine
   cd HexEngine
   git clone https://github.com/samortiz/HexEngine.git
   
 - Copy all the AndroidStudio generated files into the new repo
  cp -r project/OrigHexEngine/. project/HexEngine
 
 - Then you can verify it works and delete the OrigHexEngine
